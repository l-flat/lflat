<h2>Problem: First (LR)</h2>

Consider the following grammar
<ul>
S -> E<br>
E -> e | pF;<br>
F -> E | EF
</ul>

Now create the corresponding deterministic finite automaton of the valid items LR(1) and then build a response <b>firstANS</b> for the following five questions:

<ul>
<li> How many states does the automaton have?
<li> In how many states does LR(0) conflicts occur?
<li> Is the grammar LR(0)?
<li> Is the grammar LR(1)?
<li> Is the grammar LALR(1)?
</ul>
