<h2>Problem: Even A Has B (FA)</h2>


Please create an deterministic finite automaton <b>evenahasbFA</b> that recognizes the following language over the alphabet {a, b, c}:
<ul>
L = {w in T<sup>*</sup>: w is made of an even number of "a"s and contains at least one "b"}.
</ul>
Do not forget that zero is an even number.
